# Whitewater Park flow estimates with Northern Integrated Supply Project (NISP) impacts

The code consists of:
  - Historical flows at the Downtown Fort Collins, CO gauge
    - Split into quartiles to get hydrologic year types: wet, wet-typical, dry-typical, and dry years
  - Altered flows based on Environmental Impact Statement diversion amounts (released by US Army Corp of Engineers)
    - [Impacts on 40-year study period ](https://github.com/nayhur/whitewaterpark-flows/blob/master/AnnualHydrograph.png) - split into hydrologic year types
    - [Boatable Days](https://github.com/nayhur/whitewaterpark-flows/blob/master/BoatableDays.png) estimate using the threshold 355 cfs, collected by economic survey
